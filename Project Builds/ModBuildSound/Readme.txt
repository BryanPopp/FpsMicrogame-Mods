For my first mod of the microgame I added three different models and two sound effects. I went for a bit of a Halloween theme as we are about a month
and a half away at this point. For 3D models I specifically added a Jack-O-lantern, skull, and candles all imported from the asset store. As for my sound 
effects I added a spooky laugh on a trigger when approaching the skull at the end of the level and a new victory noise. Also apart of the requirements
some spooky music to fit the Halloween theme.
